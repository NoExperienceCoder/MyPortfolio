            <p class="bolded">
                Hello! I'm Nikunj Saini, a passionate and curious person who enjoys discovering and learning 
                new things. At Cluster Innovation Center, University of Delhi, I am currently a student seeking 
                a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology and Mathematical Innovation.
            </p>
            <p class="subded">
                I have always had an interest in mathematics. This was the subject that always made me learn more about it. 
                Along with mathematics, I also became interested in computer science. I started my CS journey by learning 
                C++ in my matriculation. Later I expanded my knowledge of programming languages by learning JavaScript, 
                Java and Python. I integrated my knowledge of mathematics and coding to make some interesting projects. 
                During my exploration period, I came across ethical hacking. This field helped me know about the threats that
                we are exposed to online and how we can protect ourselves from such attacks. As I dived deeper into coding, I 
                learned about machine learning and artificial intelligence. While exploring the field of AI/ML, I learned about 
                Data Science, feature engineering and some of the most commonly used architectures of ML. I even worked on 
                Generative Models and Natural Language Processing. You can have a look at them in the projects section. 
            </p>
            <p class="subded">
                Other than coding, I am also fond of writing blogs. Whenever I find something interesting and worth sharing, 
                I usually blog about it on Medium. You can always go through them and provide feedback on them. 
            </p>
            <p class="subded">
                My other hobbies include cooking, reading articles about socio-political events and following major events 
                happening around me.
